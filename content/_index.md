## Hey 👋

I'm Mateen, a software engineer interested in
data storage, distributed systems and Go.

I am currently working on my personal project, an in-memory storage, [Memorabillia](https://github.com/mateenbagheri/memorabilia). It is not being developed in a fast paced environment, but I am okay with taking my time on it.

I am also a member of [Abramad](https://www.abramad.com/) team, an Iranian cloud provider a subsidiary of [System Group](https://www.systemgroup.net/).

I love meeting new people. If you'd like to grab a coffee or chat,  
feel free to send an email to `mateenbagheridev` at Gmail and we can set something up. 🙂
