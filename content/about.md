Hey there 👋 I’m **Mateen**.  

I’m a software engineer who loves working with **data storage**, **distributed systems**, and the **Go programming language**. Most of the time, I’m either trying to make systems faster, more reliable, or just a little bit more fun to use.  

Right now, I’m part of the **Abramad team** at [System Group](https://www.systemgroup.net/). In the past, I’ve built things like real-time logging systems, encrypted chat services and some more. always learning something new along the way.  

When I’m not working, I like to tinker on side projects. My favorite one is **[Memorabilia](https://github.com/mateenbagheri/memorabilia)**, an in-memory storage project I’ve been slowly shaping into a key–value database. It’s my little playground for experimenting with concurrency, performance tuning, and design ideas.
